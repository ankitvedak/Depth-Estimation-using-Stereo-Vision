To compile the library on your computer and add the python lib

1. Install Visual Studio with c++ development environment if you are on windows.

2. Inside the source folder, open command prompt and run:
   
   
   Linux:
   
   ```
   sudo ./setup.py install
   ```

   Windows:
   
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

   
   
   And everything should work and just check the simple implementation on **mean_shift_segmentation.py**
